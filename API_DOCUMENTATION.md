# ONYX API Documentation

## Overview

The ONYX API is a RESTful backend that manages buildings, assessments, users, and related data. All endpoints require authentication, and some require admin authorization.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require a valid JWT token. Include it in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.

### Auth Endpoints

| POST   | /auth/register   | Register a user    | `{ email, password, role }` |
| POST   | /auth/login      | Login a user       | `{ email, password }` |

#### Registration example (POST /auth/register):

```json
{
  "email": "testuser@example.com",
  "password": "TestPassword123!",
  "role": "admin"
}
```
