# ONYX API Documentation

## Overview
The ONYX API is a RESTful backend that manages buildings, assessments, users, and related data. All endpoints require authentication, and some require admin authorization.

## Authentication
Most endpoints require a valid JWT token. Include it in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.

| POST   | /auth/login      | Login a user       | `{ email, password }` |
